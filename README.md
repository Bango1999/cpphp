This is nonfunctional at the moment

It has worked precariously on Nitrous.io, in this PHP format.  I also have another nonworking node implementation in another repository.

Utilizes bash and g++ to perform php CLI executions, namely compilation and execution of C++ files, which the user inputs the raw code for via a glorified textarea in their browser window.

Takes parameters at this point rather than asking the user for realtime stdin queries.
